# Block Production

DropIt is designed to be entirely open an permissionless. Anyone can run a node and build new blocks for the chain.

The canonical history of the DropIt chain will be decided by the finalized state of the Polkadot relay chain.

See [economics](./economics.md) to learn more about the incentives for block producers.
