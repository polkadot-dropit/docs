# Economics

DropIt is entirely powered by the Polkadot's native DOT token and has no native token of its own.

## Deposits

Since DropIt is intended to be an [ephemeral chain](./lifetime.md), storage deposits are not required to use the chain.

Existential deposit of the chain will be zero, as will the deposits to create, accept, or interact with different parts of the chain.

## Treasury

A portion of all transaction fees will be transferred to a treasury managed by the [governance](./governance.md) of DropIt.

These funds will be used to pay for costs needed to run and improve the network over time.

## Block Reward

The rest of the transaction fees will be transferred to block authors as a reward for producing a block.

An additional tip can be included by users making transactions on the network to incentivize the creation of a new block and inclusion of that transaction in the block.

See [block production](./block-production.md)
