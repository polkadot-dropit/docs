# Fungible Tokens

DropIt will not be able to mint fungible tokens on its own. Instead, it will work with Polkadot's Asset Hub to manage fungible assets.

Users that want to use DropIt to distribute a fungible token will first mint that asset on the Asset Hub.

Then they reserve transfer that asset to DropIt, where it can easily and cheaply be [distributed](./distribution.md).

Users are able to transfer or trade assets while on DropIt.

When they are ready, users can then claim assets back on the Asset Hub.
