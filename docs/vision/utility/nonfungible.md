# Non-Fungible Tokens

DropIt will not be able to make new NFT collections on its own. Instead, it will work with Polkadot's Asset Hub to manage non-fungible assets.

Users that want to use DropIt to distribute and mint new non-fungible tokens will first mint an empty collection on the Asset Hub. The collection owner must give the Asset Hub the minter role for that collection.

Then, on DropIt the collection owner can cheaply and easily mint and [distribute](./distribution.md) NFTs.

Users are able to transfer or trade non-fungible tokens while on DropIt.

When they are ready, users can claim their NFTs back onto the Asset Hub where they will be officially minted.
